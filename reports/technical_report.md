# Domain Name Suggestion LLM Evaluation Report

## Summary

Framework for evaluating domain name generation models with systematic testing and LLM-as-a-judge evaluation.

## Dataset & Model

**Dataset**: 1,000 synthetic domain names across 12 business types (tech, restaurant, consulting, etc.)
**Model**: Microsoft DialoGPT-medium with LoRA fine-tuning
**Training**: 3 epochs, learning rate 5e-5, batch size 8

## Results

**Evaluation Performance** (2 test samples):

- Average scores: 5.0/10 across all metrics (relevance, creativity, uniqueness, safety, grammar)
- Evaluation errors detected in judge feedback
- Generated domains: "techflow.com", "tastebuds.com"

**Edge Case Analysis** (12 cases):

- All cases: relevance problems (ambiguous requests)
- Severity: 100% low priority
- Main issue: Model doesn't ask for clarification on vague prompts

## Key Findings

1. **Evaluation Issues**: LLM judge encountered errors during scoring
2. **Edge Case Pattern**: Model generates generic domains for unclear requests
3. **Limited Testing**: Only 2 samples evaluated, 12 edge cases discovered

## Recommendations

1. Fix LLM judge evaluation errors
2. Implement clarification logic for ambiguous prompts
3. Expand evaluation dataset
4. Improve prompt engineering
