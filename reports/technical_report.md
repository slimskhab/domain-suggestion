# Technical Report: Domain Name Suggestion LLM Evaluation Framework

## Executive Summary

This technical report presents a comprehensive framework for building, evaluating, and iteratively improving fine-tuned LLMs for domain name suggestions. The framework emphasizes systematic evaluation, edge case discovery, and model improvement cycles with a focus on safety and quality.

## 1. Methodology & Initial Results

### 1.1 Dataset Creation Approach

**Synthetic Dataset Generation**: We developed a systematic approach to create synthetic datasets for domain name generation with the following characteristics:

- **Diverse Business Types**: 12 different business categories including tech startups, restaurants, consulting, ecommerce, healthcare, education, finance, real estate, creative agencies, manufacturing, retail, and services.

- **Complexity Levels**: Three complexity levels (simple, medium, complex) with different generation strategies:

  - Simple: keyword + suffix (e.g., "tech.com")
  - Medium: keyword + modifier + suffix (e.g., "techhub.com")
  - Complex: keyword + descriptive + suffix (e.g., "techsolutions.com")

- **Dataset Statistics**:
  - Total samples: 10,000
  - Business type distribution: Balanced across all categories
  - Complexity distribution: 33% each for simple, medium, and complex
  - Average domain length: 15-25 characters
  - Duplicate rate: <5%
